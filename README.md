# Note.sh
> A bash script to allow a user to take notes on the go! (not final)

## Setup
to setup all you need to do is add your file to the bin folder and make sure that it is executable (ik there are better ways)\
then open your favourite terminal, run the **command** _note.sh (your filename)_ (ofc you can just rename the note.sh to just *note*)\

## Todo
* bind a shortcut to it
* make the notes get converted to PDF's
* get the notes automatically uploaded to a cloud service
